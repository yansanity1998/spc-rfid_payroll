# Scholarship System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive scholarship management system for Faculty users in the SPC RFID Payroll system.

## Database Schema

### Scholarship Table
Created `sql/create_scholarship_table.sql` with the following structure:

**Table: `scholarship`**
- `id` - Serial primary key
- `user_id` - BIGINT foreign key to users table
- `has_scholarship` - Boolean (whether faculty has scholarship)
- `scholarship_period` - VARCHAR(50) - Options: '1st sem', '2nd sem', 'Whole School Year'
- `school_year` - VARCHAR(20) - e.g., '2024-2025'
- `amount` - DECIMAL(10, 2) - Scholarship amount in pesos
- `notes` - TEXT - Additional scholarship details
- `created_at` - Timestamp with timezone
- `updated_at` - Timestamp with timezone

**Features:**
- Unique constraint on (user_id, school_year, scholarship_period)
- Indexes on user_id and school_year for performance
- RLS disabled for unrestricted access (following project pattern)
- ON DELETE CASCADE for automatic cleanup

## Frontend Implementation

### UserManagement.tsx Updates

**1. State Management**
- Added `scholarshipData` state to track scholarship information
- Initialized with default values (has_scholarship: false)

**2. Edit Modal Enhancement**
- Scholarship section only appears when editing Faculty users
- Conditional rendering based on `editUser.role === "Faculty"`
- Beautiful yellow-themed UI matching scholarship concept

**3. Scholarship Fields**
- **Has Scholarship**: Radio buttons (Yes/No)
- **Scholarship Period**: Dropdown with options:
  - 1st Semester
  - 2nd Semester
  - Whole School Year
- **School Year**: Text input (e.g., 2024-2025)
- **Scholarship Amount**: Number input with peso symbol
- **Notes**: Textarea for additional details

**4. Data Loading**
- When Edit button is clicked for Faculty users:
  - Fetches existing scholarship data from database
  - Populates form with current scholarship information
  - Shows most recent scholarship record

**5. Data Saving**
- **If has_scholarship = Yes**:
  - Checks if scholarship record exists
  - Updates existing record or inserts new one
  - Validates required fields (period, school year)
- **If has_scholarship = No**:
  - Deletes all scholarship records for the user
  - Cleans up database automatically

## User Experience
